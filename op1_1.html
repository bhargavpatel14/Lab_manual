				My dog Sasho is my best friend. she likes to choose the soccer boll when I pratice. It is so funny tosee 
				her running down the field trying to catch the ball with her mouth. It just won't fit!

					Once Sasho saved my life. When I was only 4years old. I started to go into the street to get a ball that
					had rolled across the street.<U> Of course I did not think to look for</U> cars! Sasho got in front of
					me and knocked me backwards onto the sidewalk.I was mad until I saw the car go by where I would have been.
					Then I was so happy that Sasho was smarter then I was!
